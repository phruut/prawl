## ðŸ”¥features
- launch brawlhalla from gui (+auto launch on script start option)
- set custom values and adjust timings
- auto start matches, also configurable
- show/hide brawlhalla window
- runs in the background (no interruption as it directly sends inputs to the brawlhalla window only)
- gold/exp rate limit detection (starts again after waiting for the rate limit to reset)
- super light weight and minimal dependencies as its basically just a timer script
- check for update button

_please see the [wiki](https://github.com/phruut/prawl/wiki) for more information about the script_
