## ðŸ”¥features
- launch brawlhalla from script (+auto launch on script start option)
- set custom values for script behavior timing adjustments
- auto start matches, also configurable
- show/hide brawlhalla window
- runs in the background (no interruption as it directly sends inputs to the brawlhalla window only)
- exp rate limit detection (starts again after waiting for the rate limit to reset)
- very light weight and minimal dependencies as it is basically just a timer script

### other
- [ ] pixel search mode
- [ ] fix input bugs(?)
